      <h2>Rino Gaetano</h2>

    <div id="tribute-info">
    <p class="info">
      Salvatore Antonio "Rino" Gaetano (29 October 1950 – 2 June 1981) was an Italian musician and singer-songwriter. He is famous for his satirical songs and oblique yet incisive political commentary. He is remembered for his raspy voice, for the heavily ironic lyrics of his songs and his social protests. He died in a car accident at age 30. He was a popular and influential figure, widely re-evaluated by the following teen generations. 
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      Salvatore Antonio Gaetano was born in Crotone, Calabria. In March 1960, at the age of ten, his family moved to Rome, where he would spend the rest of his life. By 1967 he created a quartet with a group of friends called Krounks, who would mainly play cover songs. They were inspired by Italian artists such as Enzo Jannacci, Fabrizio De André, Adriano Celentano as well as international musicians such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      In 1969, Gaetano approached Folkstudio, a well-known club in Rome for promoting young artists. His style proved to be very different from that of the other musicians. His strong use of irony caused concerns for the club managers, as he recounted: 
    </p> 
    <div class="quote">
    <q> When I sang at Folkstudio, it was the centre of discussions....in fact they did not want me to do many of my pieces because they thought I wanted to make fun of everyone.</q>
    </div>
    <p class="info">
      In 1972, he recorded his first 45 rpm record containing the songs "Jacqueline" and "La ballata di Renzo", a song which features lyrics that echo details of his own death. Rino decided to release the single under a pseudonym. According to his producer, the choice of using a pseudonym was a sign of shyness and insecurity of Gaetano: 
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
    <q>
      He considered himself a writer, not a singer. He believed he didn't have a good voice, so that after the release of I Love You Marianna, when the time came to record his first album, he came and told me that it would be better to get someone else to sing the songs. I, of course, I laughed and sent him in the studio."
    </q>
    </div>
    <p class="info">
      In 1974, he published his first album, <i> Ingresso libero</i>. The LP featured many of the themes that would characterise his work, such as issues of isolation, marginalisation and exclusion, as well as his lively style and intelligent, witty lyrics.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      Success for Gaetano came the following year with the 45 rpm hit record <i>"Ma il cielo è sempre più blu"</i> ("But the sky is always bluer"), perhaps now the most famous and instantly recognisable of his songs. In this song Gaetano offers several pictures of everyday life, with irony, clichés and contradictions. In September 1975, the singer explained the essence of the song:
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
    <q>
      These pictures are sad, never happy, because I wanted to emphasise that nowadays there are few cheerful things and it is for this reason that I take into account those who die at work. Even the verse "who plays Sanremo" is sad and negative, because anyone who plays Sanremo, doesn't think of those who "live in barracks".
